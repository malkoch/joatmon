Remember the transaction.

Accepts a state, action, reward, next_state, terminal transaction.

# Arguments

### _forward_unimplemented
```python
._forward_unimplemented(
   *inp: Any
)
```

---
Defines the computation performed at every call.

Should be overridden by all subclasses.

.. note::
Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within
this function, one should call the :class:`Module` instance afterwards
instead of this since the former takes care of running the
registered hooks while the latter silently ignores them.
