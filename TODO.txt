- instead of callback use event
- remove utility, serializable, event, context module, instead use core functions and classes
- remove tensorflow and torch dependencies, use our own nn module, let people set backend, context can be used
- minimax, maximim algorithms to ai module
- alpha-beta pruning, monte carlo to ai module - maybe policies
- if any connection is not transactional, do the action and close the action
    - afterwards open the connection again
- if any connection is transactional, wait for the commit action, then close the action
    - afterwards open the connection again

- need to implement inplace
- need to implement loss functions
- need to implement min, max methods
- need to implement greater etc. methods
- if the input is parameter, just do the calculation

- should have c / c++ codes to use them in functional apis

- implement the array module as well, check the performance and correctness using numpy
